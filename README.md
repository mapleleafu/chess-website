# Memory Rush

Memory Rush is a dynamic web-based game designed to enhance and challenge your memory using chess positions. Tailored for chess enthusiasts and cognitive training aficionados alike, the game offers three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard, catering to players of all skill levels.

## How to Play

1. **Select Difficulty:** Choose your preferred difficulty level. As you select higher difficulties, both the available time and the number of attempts decrease.
2. **Memorize Chess Board:** A chess board with a specific arrangement of pieces will be displayed. Your task is to memorize the placement of each piece.
3. **Recreate Position:** After the allotted time, the pieces will vanish. You must then replicate the original arrangement from memory. The number of attempts you get to place the pieces correctly will depend on the selected difficulty level.
4. **Submit & Review:** Once you're confident in your placement, hit "Submit" to check if you've correctly recreated the original position. If you've run out of attempts or successfully recreated the position, the game will redirect you to the game history page, where you can review your previous attempts, highlighting correct, incorrect, and missing placements.

### Game Features

- **Instant Feedback:** The game provides detailed feedback immediately after submission. Correctly placed pieces are marked in green, incorrect ones in red, and missing pieces are highlighted with transparency.
- **Attempt History:** Review your progress and learn from past mistakes with an accessible history of your attempts, helping you to improve over time.
